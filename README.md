# Hackthon_Participation_CategoryClassification
Classify Category of the Problem based on given dataset

This data represents Dataset of a commpany which is providing OnCall service to customers for various problem categories.
like, Car breakdown, Home repair etc.

There are three different categories of data given in dataset. Dataset is very skewed with 6001, ~300 and ~100 records for three categories respectively.

I performed Data Imputation, Scalling, Correlation Analysis and Feature engineering of Date Columns as per my understanding.

First, I applied Undersampling and achieved 78-80 % accuracy on Training data.
And in second part, I applied Oversampling technique SMOTE and achieved 95-96 % accuracy on Training data.

Any feedback about improving my solution will be appreciated.

Thanks,
Kunjan Shah.
